Problem:
Make a program in C/C++ or Java language that calculates the length of a string informed by the user (do not use any pre-existing function or method for this, such as len(), count(), strlen() or lenght());




**To test this code:
Compile and run Main.cpp.
The program asks the user to input a string. A maximum size for the string is specified in code. If the user attempts to input a string with size bigger than allowed, program will ask again until the size is within limits.
