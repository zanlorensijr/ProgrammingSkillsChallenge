Problem:
Make a program in C/C++ or Java language that reverses a string informed by the user without using any temporary variable, buffer or any pre-existing function or method for this.




**To test this code:
Compile and run Main.cpp.
The program asks the user to input a string. The program outputs the same string but reversed. The reverse string is calculated based on the algorithm below to swap values a and b with the bitwise xor operation:
     a=a^b
     b=a^b
     a=a^b
