Problem:
Write a C/C++ or Java program that prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.

For each multiple of 3, print "Foo" instead of the number.
For each multiple of 5, print "Baa" instead of the number.
For multiple numbers simultaneously of 3 and 5, print "FooBaa", instead of the number.

Your solution should be using as few lines of code as possible, but you should produce efficient code.




**To test this code:
1) Just compile and run main.cpp, and look at results (output variable).

In this problem, we use the results from multiples of 3 and 5 to produce the result for the multiples of 15, so to avoid redundant checks.
